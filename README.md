# Movie_Genre_Prediction_using_Posters
Using Posters of movies to Predict predict the multiple genere that movie may beong to using Deep Learning techniques. 
Project was built using Pytorch and was able to achieve "validation accuracy": 0.9117, "train loss": 0.2087, "validation loss": 0.2463, "F1 score": 0.3672. 
Project was quite grueling as it required knowledge of many verticals such as image processing, dataset customization, ecoding techniques,
pandas, pytorch, deep Learning, model building and testing.
